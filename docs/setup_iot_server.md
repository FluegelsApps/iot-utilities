# IoT Server Setup

The app's IoT Server function accepts connections from Aruba controllers and Aruba Instant access points via the Aruba IoT interface using the secure WebSocket protocol and Google Protocol Buffer 2.0 for data encoding (telemetry-websocket). The IoT Server only allows encrypted connections (TLS/SSL). The required SSL server certificate can be imported into the app or a self-signed certificate can be generated.

Please set up the user account for server authentication and web dashboard access.

The password is not viewable and will be encrypted. Please take a note of your password in a secure place.
